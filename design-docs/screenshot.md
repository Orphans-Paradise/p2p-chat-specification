# screenshot

## description

Can use shortcut keys or screenshot buttons to capture a part of the screen as a picture and send it automatically.

## why design

- Improve the function of sending pictures. Sending pictures currently only supports copying pictures from the local and pasting them into the input box to achieve the function of sending pictures. The screenshot function allows users to intercept pictures and send them directly, without the need to use other screenshot tools to save local pictures and send them. Greatly convenient.
