# theme-change

## description

The theme of the software interface can be customized, such as font style, background image of chat box, channel avatar, or the theme package provided by the developer can be selected to beautify the application software, improve the user experience and look and feel.

## why design

- The application comes with a single theme, and users are prone to visual fatigue when facing an identical theme for a long time. At the same time, a single theme cannot meet the perception needs of different users. Supporting user-defined themes can allow users to modify the application software interface according to their own aesthetic wishes and improve User experience.
- Some users may not want to set themes themselves for some reasons, but do not want to use an interface theme all the time. They can choose other theme packages provided by the developers in the software, which can also achieve the purpose of changing the interface theme.
