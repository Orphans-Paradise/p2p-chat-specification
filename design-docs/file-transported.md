# video-transported

## description

In the channel, you can send by selecting a local file, or receive files from other nodes in the channel and save them locally. There is a limit to the file size, and there is a limit to the file transfer speed.

## why design

- File transfer includes the transfer of files such as video, pictures, audio, etc. It is very useful as an extended function of the chat tool.
- Adding the file transfer function can expand the customer base to a certain extent. Nowadays, FTP transfer can be said to be the mainstream of real-time transfer. Many people are always subject to many restrictions when transferring files between each other, such as transfer speed, size, membership, etc., QQ has obvious defects in transferring files: first I am a friend. Secondly, the files have to pass the QQ review. Some files will be inexplicably unable to be transferred, and the size of the files transferred is limited.
- Our product is originally a point-to-point transmission, and the function of file transmission can be icing on the cake.
